# Well hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smadd/Smadd/master/Cliply_co_wave.gif" width="30px"> 

**I'm Stephanie. Welcome to my GitHub!**

:chart_with_upwards_trend:I'm excited to use Data Science methods to show the big picture on issues and shed light on details (I *really* geek out on details :smile_cat:).

:earth_americas:My awe of the natural world and intrigue for human behavior has led me on a mission to make the world a kinder, safer, more equitable place. While making an impact for various causes along the way in person, I am now shifting my focus to the tech world to find connections, solve problems, and improve lives, digitally.

:star2:I am growing in Data Science and have particular interests in finance, health/wellness, and sustainability, so you may see those themes and fun info in my practice. I will also post portfolio projects here with new updates on the way.
